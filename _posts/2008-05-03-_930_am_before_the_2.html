<p>Mark Williams' article <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/20463/page1/">Weather Engineering in China</a> does an excellent job of tracing the history of weather modification in the midst of lively murmurs about China's experimentation with artificially induced rainstorms in an effort to guarantee clear skies for the 2008 Games.<br /><br />China was not the first to experiment with this superhuman feat. Russia relied on similar measures in 1986 during the Chernobyl disaster and Williams credits American General Electric (GE) scientist Bernard Vonnegut (brother of Kurt Vonnegut) with initial research in using silver iodine crystals to attract water molecules.</p>

Morning.&nbsp;Before the storm.&nbsp;9:30 am</p>

<p>The idea of shooting chemical elements into the atmosphere using military weapons -- rocket launchers and artillery -- paints a dystopic image. The city is dark before a storm.</p>

  Noon. The rain came. 12:00 pm
</p>

<p>The artificially induced rain speaks to a different relationship with nature; our environment is to be dominated in the service of man's grand ambitions. Hasn't this been the case since the industrial revolution? Maybe.</p>

<p>The pitfalls and dangers of taking this attitude to heart can be found in China's history, such as the famines that followed the Great Leap Forward.</p>

Evening. Pink afterglow. 7:35 pm</p>
  
<p>The view from my apartment window. The sky always turns pink after a storm. For the next couple of days, the air will feel the freshest it has in weeks.</p>
