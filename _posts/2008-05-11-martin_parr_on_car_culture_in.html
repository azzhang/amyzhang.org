One of my favorite photographers, Martin Parr, brings his critical eye to the Beijing Auto Show. <a href="http://blog.magnumphotos.com/2008/04/auto_crazy.html">Parr talks about the growing love of cars in China</a>, Beijing's infamous traffic and the worship of high-end luxury goods.<br /><br />Over 700 000 people attended the 10th Beijing Auto Show held two weekends ago, not surprising given the number of cars in Beijing has tripled from 1.12 million in 2001 to an estimated 3.5 million by the time the Olympic Games is scheduled to begin in 2008. Four-wheel drive vehicles have replaced the democratic bicycle in China, resulting in gridlock, pollution and the highest traffic accident rate in the world. <br /><br />In the west, as green types, and increasingly more mainstream media, city councils, and urban planners have began to criticize the destructive consequences of car culture, to point out the pitfalls of rising private car ownership in China is still a sensitive topic. In China, owning your own car is a sign of prestige and wealth. For many Chinese, the growing number of cars in the country is viewed as a sign of a healthy developing economy. As Parr points out, given that about 90% of families in the west own a car, while in China this figure is only about 6%, it's easy to see why the first reaction many Chinese people have towards the criticism of the growing number of private vehicles  in China is, if Americans and Europeans can own cars, then why can't we?<br /><br />Until a new awareness towards car ownership in China develops, urban planners will continue to build highways instead of bike lanes.<br /><br />
