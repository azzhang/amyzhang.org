Peter Hessler's <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/2008/05/19/080519on_onlineonly_hessler">Sichuan postcard </a>is a tribute to the people of the recent disaster. This article humanizes the images of suffering we see on TV, where victims' bodies sometimes function as nothing more than just another political photo opt. After the cameras leave and the media frenzy dissipates, this region will fade from the public eye and most people will remember this region as nothing more than just a disaster zone.
