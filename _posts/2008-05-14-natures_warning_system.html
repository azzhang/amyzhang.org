<p>In retrospect, an original local interest story on the increased number of toads on the move in the Sichuan countryside three days before the quake can now be seen as a prescient reminder of nature's own built-in disaster warning system. Some local residents wondered whether the toads were a sign of an impending natural disaster, but this suspicion was quickly brushed off. When the reporter asked a resident why he thought there were so many toads on the move, he joked, the Olympics are coming this year, the toads are probably here to welcome the Games.</p>
