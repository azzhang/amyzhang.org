<p>For the last four years, the countdown clock in Tiananmen Square has patiently marked off each second as Beijing prepared for an event that has been dubbed "a hundred years in the making." However, in the last few days, the city feels like it could not wait a single moment longer. With just over 21 hours to go, many have already started the celebrations.</p>

<p>The torch arrived in Beijing on August 6th. An hour after television images showed Yao Ming displaying the flame proudly, and for just a few moments longer than other torch bearers, we joined a crowd by the Olympic Green. Large drums kept spirits high and people were ready to cheer on the relay. However, on this leg of the journey, the Olympic flame passed by in the window of a van, although no doubt proudly displayed by a carefully selected torch bearer. The crowd learned that day that the modern Olympic flame travels in more ways than one.</p>

  George Bush's visit to Beijing has been preempted by his speech in Thailand that ended with the prophetic words "change will come." Bush will be inaugurating the new American embassy in Beijing, which is second in size only to the American embassy in Baghdad. No doubt the compound and most of the city will be under lockdown tomorrow. The celebrations, if not a hundred years, then definitely a decade in the making, will be measured and controlled. Spontaneous bursts of excitement will have to be tempered with restraint that stem from deep fears of chaos.
