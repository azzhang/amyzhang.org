Don't let the seemingly morbid subject matter of the <a href="http://www.davidmaisel.com/works/picture.asp?cat=lod&amp;tl=library%20of%20dust">Library of Dust</a> project discourage you from reading <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/library-of-dust.html">Geoff Manaugh's meditative piece</a> about dust, corrosion, life and photography.  In a perfect union between critic and artist, David Maisel's bizarre genius is made comprehensible by Manaugh's writing.
