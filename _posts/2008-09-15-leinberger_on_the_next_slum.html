Geoff Manaugh's post on <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/">BLDGBLOG</a> about the state of private housing in the UK points to  Christopher B. Leinberger's article in the Atlantic about the transition of suburbs into <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200803/subprime">The Next Slum </a>-- from the American dream into a way of life that people are increasingly leaving behind. The concept of suburban living was originally introduced at the 1930-1940 New York World's Fair through the GM exhibition "Futurama" which proposed cities surrounded by highways and suburbs as what good living will look like 20 years into the future.

But more importantly, the move away from the pursuit of suburban living is both a reflection and a result of the changing ways in which our generation imagines the city and urban life. As Leinberger points out, shows like <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Friends</span>, <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Seinfeld</span> and <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Sex and the City</span> showcased "the city's urban allure to Gen-Xers and Millennials," while when "Hollywood wants to portray soulless, despair or moral decay" it often looks to the suburbs for inspiration as is the case with <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">The Sopranos</span> and <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Desperate Housewives</span>.</div><div><br /></div><div>If American cities began by developing vertically before developing horizontally only to move towards more localized communities, when and in what form will this transition take place in the many developing cities of Asia, Africa, and Latin America that are currently adopting the sprawl model complete with SUVs and highways?</div></div>
