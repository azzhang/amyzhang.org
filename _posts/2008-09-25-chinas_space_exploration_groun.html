And one of them is me. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/world/AP-AS-China-Space.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin">China's launch of the Shenzhou 7</a>  has caused an unannounced closure of the Beijing International Airport which has come as a sudden surprise to most airlines around the world. I'm waiting for Dragon Air to handout free meal vouchers to make up for the now over two-hour delay, and our flight is rumored to be grounded until midnight. This disorder is an appropriate end to a week in Hong Kong where a T-8 Typhoon rocked the island, bankers raced around like mad and mothers brought their babies to hospitals to test for potential kidney stones from consuming mainland milk products. <div><div><br /></div></div>
