The Eastern or the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/the-worlds-rubbish-dump-a-garbage-tip-that-stretches-from-hawaii-to-japan-778016.html">Great Pacific Garbage patch</a> in the North Pacific Ocean is a stark reminder of how our lifestyles are threatening our <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/tv/blueplanet/">Blue Planet</a>. While many studies have been conducted in recent years, especially by the <a href="http://www.algalita.org/">Algalita Marine Research Foundation,</a> there's little discussion in terms of solutions.  Understandably, it is difficult to deal with a liquid trash patch that has been said to be one and a half times the size of the United States. And then there is the issue of responsibility. While we have institutions to discuss and to issue a financial bailout, when problems occurs outside of national borders, even when they threaten everyone equally, we have little resources to come up with a solution. <div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
