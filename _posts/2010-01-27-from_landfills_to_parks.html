Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island is being transformed into a 2,200 acre park about three times the size of Central Park with meadows and wetland, which will be named <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/nyregion/26bird.html">Freshkills park</a>, a thin disguise for the strange name. Ironically, this marks a return to the land's original eco-system as it was thought that <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/fkl/fkl6.shtml">Fresh Kill</a>, prior to being transformed into a landfill was dominated by a vast tidal wetland fed by fresh water spring and streams. The word "kill" is Old-Dutch for stream, brook, or channel. &nbsp;Bird-watchers however, have been drawn to the site for some time with binoculars in hand, expecting to spot even the rare <a href="http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/red-tailed-hawk.html">red-tailed hawk</a>. Other more famous urban American parks developed on landfills include the <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/urbanwilds/DumpShoreline.asp">Millennium Park</a> in Boston, the <a href="http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/ContentDisplay.aspx?id=12102">Cesar Chavez Park</a> in Berkeley, and <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/travel/beaches/bal-bab-vatrashmore,0,4662582.story">Mount Trashmore</a> in Virginia Beach.&nbsp;
