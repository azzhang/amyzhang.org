<p>The <a href="http://senseable.mit.edu/foragetracking/?page_id=12">Forage Tracking project</a> at the SENSEable city lab at MIT maps the collection routes of
informal recyclers (catadores) who collect and sell recyclables to industry. Vik Muniz's document <i><a href="http://www.wastelandmovie.com/reviews.html">Wasteland</a></i>, recently featured the of waste pickers on Jardim Gramacho, a landfill north of Rio De Janeiro,
ahead of government efforts to formalize recycling. In Sao Paulo, the Forage Tacking project provides a spatial
dimension to how waste circulates at a neighbourhood level using GPS and mobile
phones. &nbsp;</p>
