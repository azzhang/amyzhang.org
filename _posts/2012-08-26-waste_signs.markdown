<p>City walls display messages. Walls present official signs, illicit signs, political signs and personal marks. There are great forces in modern cities goes aimed at controlling these marks, to ensure that some are broadcast and others banned, others existing momentarily only they would make themselves disappear when necessary. In other words, signs are enabled, or made mobile or elusive by the larger political condition of their production.  The loudness of signs and their reach are one way of looking at forces of power battling for control of the public imagination in city streets.</p>

<p>Graffiti artists take advantage of public space to make political statements and advertisers gravitate towards open spaces to cultivate desires. Walls, bus stops and sidewalks, any flat surface can become a battle ground for who can promote their messages. In China, if not for the tens of thousands of sanitary workers diligently sweeping with their wheat stalk brooms and little metal chisels, overpasses and sidewalks would be littered with little white business card sized stickers, a way that migrant construction and maintenance workers to advertise, to make sure that you know who to call if you ever need a plumber. The amount of labor for hire in Chinese cities -- people to help you move, make you breakfast, fix leaks and collect your scraps -- ensures the continuous rhythms of the city, yet authorities work to eliminate these support networks to speak through signs on the street, preferring to advertise their own messages while conditioning the reach and access of other voices.

<p>Each sign have an intended audience and an appropriate context. Most political messages target the passerby, working subliminally. They are displayed at the most prominent spots where crowds are most likely to stop, linger and stare into space, receiving the message while thinking about what's for dinner. Other messages are prominent enough just to alert to the audience that there is a message and you know where to look if you ever need the details, to hit receive and upload in your mind.

<p>One clue into who controls waste and how it circulates in Chinese cities begins with noticing waste signs. Like all signs, some are loud and scream at you from afar, and others are hidden and quiet yet carry authority. The anatomy of the sign needs to be taken apart -- the conditions of their production, meanings and effects, intended and unintended. Some signs follow faithfully in the tradition of political messages, alive and well today still, even in post-reform China. Other are declarations of exclusion and deserve closer analysis as to the condition of their production and their purpose. The cacophony of signs and billboards exist in their own context yet, when brought together they offer competing messages and visions for waste, tied together in an intricate network. They are clues into how materials circulate today and how they should move in the future.

  Guangzhou June 2011. Poster announcing the start of the recycling campaign. In April 2011, Guangzhou became the first city to mandate recycling by law. Giant wall size posters read: "Low carbon living and a civilized Guangzhou start from garbage recycling." This poster combines contemporary environmental rhetoric that sees climate change and carbon reduction as a central problem, while it curiously also refers to the relationship between proper waste management and a civil public sphere, a focus of Chinese cities, flagship of a modern nation.

Beijing, August 2012. "There's no waste in the world." Sign at Dong Xiaokou waste market during the process of being dismantled.
</p>

<p>The poetic force of this statement is lost in its English translation. The Chinese character 物 translates to matter, or material. "There is no waste material or there is no waste in the world." Vaguely Daoist in its sentiment. Compare with Laozi's Tao Te Ching "Existence from Non-existence..." 天下万物生于有， 有生于无".

Guangzhou August 2010. Banana grove. "Garbage dumping restricted, violators will be punished severely." Here is a private declaration of authority. Littering fine are not handed out by the authorities but the owners of this banana grove have decided to take matters into their own hands. Due to traffic restrictions on highways banning large trucks from driving in cities during the day, the transportation of waste happens mostly at night. The illegal dumping of waste have become a major problem in the countryside and carries little repercussion.
