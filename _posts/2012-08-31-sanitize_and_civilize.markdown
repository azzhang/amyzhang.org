Under the thrall of China's national campaign to create "<a href="http://www.guangzhou.gov.cn/special/2007/node_1754/index.shtml">sanitary</a>" (创卫）and "<a href="http://gdgz.wenming.cn/jiangwenm/201208/t20120828_828309.html">civilized</a>" （创文）cities, Guangzhou is getting a makeover. Sidewalks are being scrubbed down and volunteers are out with multicolored sashes and thumbs-up signposts, attempting to reform traffic that obeys only one rule -- move when you get a chance. Sounds of whistles echo along with car horns at dusk in peak rush hour. Water fountains shoot synchronized white sprays into the humid air at shopping plazas that shape large city blocks. Pots of fresh flowers are wheeled out and set neatly in rows, forming slogans that broadcast "we're working towards civilization."

Navigating Guangzhou is always demanding but lately pedestrians and cyclists and even drivers, are made to move more gingerly. Crowds pause behind the large spray trucks with teams of city cleaners sweeping furiously behind and supervisors instructing in front. A quick chat with those who are responsible for this campaign, the countless number of guards and city workers,&nbsp;will tell you that they are under pressure. "Come back in a few weeks, this week we're busy 'creating civilization.'"
