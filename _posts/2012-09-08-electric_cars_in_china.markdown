The <a href="http://www.internationalrivers.org/campaigns/china-southern-power-grid">China Southern Power Grid</a> and <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/11323">Better Place</a>&nbsp;showroom sold me on the idea that electric cars can take off in China. The world's eighth largest power utility and the Palo Alto based company with projects in Israel and Copenhagen propose to bring battery swapping schemes to China's southern cities, beginning with the Pearl River Delta Region, Hainan and then to the western Guangxi, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, spanning the jurisdiction of the Southern Grid. Consumers purchase a custom designed vehicle "shell" and rent a battery that's serviced by Better Place, which provides electricity charge stations and battery swapping schemes. Each charge costs about 60 RMB (10 USD) for about 180km, cheaper than gas.

The Chinese state-owned Guangzhou Automobile Industry Group (GAIG) is tasked with developing a local vehicle "shell" model. In the showroom we were given demonstrations of the local charge station and battery switching procedure, which takes roughly one minute.&nbsp;

Like the transfer of other new technologies to the Chinese context, the introduction of electric vehicles carries environmental risks. The disposal of lithium batteries need to be monitors despite the promise of showroom staff that retired batteries will be used to store solar power. The scaling up of charge stations will most definitely put pressure on power utilities and increase demand on hydro dams, a major source of environmental conflict in southern China and Southeast Asia.&nbsp;</p><p class="p2">Of course, the success of projects, even those backed by state infrastructural companies, depend ultimately on winning over Chinese consumers. Most Chinese showrooms usually come up short even with pilot projects -- new freshly whitewashed walls grey within a few days, the ostentation of the showrooms too extravagant to appear modern. The CSG and Better Place showroom however, does a good job of projecting the innovativeness and greenness of the electric vehicle in a quiet and functional way. The difficult task ahead will be to sell the Chinese market on an idea -- that progress and modernity and most importantly luxury, rest with electric vehicles rather than Audis and BMWs.
