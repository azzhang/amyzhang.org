Production lines where white cotton strands are dyed blue, run 24 hours a day in <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/news/stories/toxics/2010/textile-pollution-xintang-gurao/">Xintang</a>, where most of the world's jeans are produced. The heavy white threads are delivered to the dye mill on large spools, and they are then lifted onto the top floor of the three-floor factory. Workers tie the end to a large connecting thread that runs the length of the line about 50 meters. If the thread breaks, workers have to manually thread it through the production line, which consists of long metal frames. Each corridor on the bottom floor hold large vats and tubes where dyes are mixed and then fed through to the vats. Threads are dipped in and then out of the vats. Steam shoots out from the pipes, making the dye spread more evenly, but also vaporizes the acidic smell of chemicals. Large pools of water lay on the floor, dyed a deep blue. Workers work 12 hour shifts, 28 days a month. The production capacity has increased year after year and they work overtime on the two days they have off a month. One the dye line, there are a handfull of workers, all men, some young, some middle aged. On the first floor, large piles of jeans lay piled on the ground where large number of women sit folded over to inspect the garments. For this dye factory, business has just begun to slow but even through the summer, production was at full capacity to meet increasing demand, a different shade of blue every season.<div><br /></div>
