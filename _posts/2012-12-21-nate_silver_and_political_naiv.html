A great post by <a href="http://mathbabe.org/2012/12/20/nate-silver-confuses-cause-and-effect-ends-up-defending-corruption/">Cathy O'Neil</a>&nbsp;about Nate Silver's book <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Signal_and_the_Noise.html?id=SI-VqAT4_hYC">The Signal and the Noise: Why Most Predictions Fail but Some Don't</a></i>. O'Neil's critique resonated with what I have feared to be the wider repercussions of this soothsayer on the battle between qualitative and quantitative research in academia. Does Nate Silver's success provide greater&nbsp;ammunition&nbsp;for questionnaires and models that produce predictions at the expense of small-scale fine-grained case-studies that yield political analysis? To be clear, I am not against quantitative methodology per se, but rather, the authority of numbers that's come to dominate the social sciences, or the so-called "economics-envy" of political science and sociology. There is nothing wrong with wanting to gather statistics. There is however, something wrong, when all qualitative case-studies are dismissed because they don't have a high enough sample size or have the same predicative capabilities as Nate Silver's models.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Criticising&nbsp;mathematical&nbsp;models on the terms of its accuracy is beyond my capacity. O'Neil's criticism, comes not on the basis of math &nbsp;(from a person who knows math) but politics, and echoes observations that anthropologists have been making for decades about the structure of "expert" and institutional knowledge. Her central critiques are:&nbsp;1) that Nate Silver misses the fact that bad and inaccurate models are constantly reproduced because they serve a function and 2) that Silver erroneously believes that expert "neutral models" trump politics. Anthropologists of development, James Ferguson's argument in&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hgXbebNQ918C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+anti-politics+machine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8OXTUPnAGYS90AHim4H4DQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA">The Anti-politics Machine</a>, point out that discourses such as "development" &nbsp;neutralizes political interest. David Mosse's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Z9u6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=david+mosse&amp;dq=david+mosse&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RObTUJP3KtO00QHgx4GQBQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA">Cultivating Development</a>&nbsp;argues the separation between policy and practice, is why failed projects in development are repeated over and over again. Most recently, works in Science and Technologies Studies question how technicality, facts, figures raises expert knowledge above local knowledge. Silver's politically neutral world of facts and statistics performs precisely this "depoliticizing" function, where experts are the only ones that we can rely on. As O'Neil points out, this is a toopsy-turvy world, one that reduces complexity and politics of the financial crisis to a tale of good intentions gone bad due to not enough information.&nbsp;</div>
